Artificial Intelligence being an integral part of modern lives, it can be used by any person with basic digital means. AI is much smarter, faster and diligent with all the work.

After the diminishing traces of  COVID-19, the Government of India has opened public places with certain precautions and safety measures. One of the Primary symptoms consistent with COVID-19 is an elevated body temperature of above 38°C (100.4°F).

 Workplaces have started screening their employees using touchless temperature scanners in order to keep a safe work environment . Since this system puts the attendant at risk, We decided to make a cloud-based thermometer which will keep records of users’ daily temperature in a spreadsheet and alarm the employee who is having rather high body temperature. This will be much safer and efficient than a conventional human attendant.

When an employee starts the process they have to declare  their  ID no. via speech-to-text then their cell would be selected in the spreadsheet . The non-contact thermometer module will record the temperature and run it through an arduino programme. 

Arduino will collect and sort the data according to the given ID number . It will also run a python programme which will automatically enter these details into a premade spreadsheet.
So Basically the whole process would be… collect the ID no.->open its cell on sheet->auto-add the temperature->run the alarm if the condition is met.
